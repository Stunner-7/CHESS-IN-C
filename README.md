# CHESS-IN-C
A chess game that can be played between two players on the terminal (optimised for Visual Studio Code).

This game doesnt contain direct checkmate function alone . Instead i have used the "more than 3 illegal moves leads to a loss" option to Denote end of game .
Also haven't considered Stalemate as a possible end.
